5.Best Time To Buy and Sell Stock(QUestion No 121) from LeetCode DSA questions
Question:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Code:

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            # Update the minimum price encountered so far
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            # Calculate the profit if we sell at the current price
            elif price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price
        
        return max_profit
